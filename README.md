## Purpose
This web application allows you to host an API.
This API is based on the Binding Of Isaac game.
It procures functionality to manipulate item and characters.

You can find the API documentation [here]()

---
## Setup Development WorkPlace

### Prerequisite

This application was built against Temurin 21, and thus requires Temurin 21+ to run.

### Clone

First you need to clone the project. You can use this command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Dylan-Langumier/DAI-Practical-Work-3.git
```
Or by downloading the [source code](https://github.com/Dylan-Langumier/DAI-Practical-Work-3/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and then unzipping in into a directory.

### How to build

#### From Intellij IDEA

Use the Run the application configuration

#### From your CLI

If you have Maven installed
```bash
mvn dependency:go-offline clean compile package
```
If you do not have Maven, we included a Maven Wrapper, which you can use to build the application:
```bash
./mvnw dependency:go-offline clean compile package
```

## API

The TboI API allows to get items or characters from the game The Binding of Isaac. It uses the HTTP protocol and the JSON
format.

The API is based on the CRUD pattern. It has the following operations:

- Create a new item/character
- Get many items that you can filter by first item pool or quality
- Get many characters
- Get one item by its id
- Update an item/character
- Delete an item/character

Users are also able to get a random item from a given item pool or given quality.
